Module execution:
	Module can be executed from analysis/003/, by any of the following commands:

	1) `mk <SPECIFIC_TARGET>`; where SPECIFIC_TARGET is any line printed by `003/bin/targets`.

	2) `bin/targets | xrags mk`; every posible target printed by 003/bin/targets will be generated in tandem.

	3) `condor submit`; parallel generation of every posible target printed by 003/bin/targets. Needs HTCondor to run.
